        This is my first major project that I&apos;ve managed to finish. This is my personal website were
        I&apos;m planning to show off all the stuff I&apos;m doing and hopefully that gets me more motivated to finish projects...
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is self hosted at home on a RasberryPi using NGINX for the server and JextJS
        as a React framework. This project has been so much fun to work on, and I will continue to add
        stuff over the years as my programming skills continue to grow and expand!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Special thanks to all those who have supported and helped me with this project. I really
        appreciate you guys. &#60;3
